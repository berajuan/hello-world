A short description

My name is Amitay Kauffmann, a Ph.D. student at the Psychological Science Scool in the University of Haifa.
My research focuses on diagnosis of mental illnesses by using a machine learning approach. Specifically, I'm interested in the diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (or, SAD for short), from recorded interactions.
